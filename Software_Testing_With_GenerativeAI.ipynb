    "\n",
    "### **Using AI for Test Case Generation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative AI models can help create meaningful test cases by analyzing user stories, specifications, and historical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example Approach:**\n",
    "1. **Input**: A user story or software requirement.\n",
    "2. **Model**: Use a pre-trained NLP model like GPT-4 to interpret the input and generate relevant test cases.\n",
    "3. **Output**: A list of test cases that cover edge cases, typical user paths, and exception handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from transformers import pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load a pre-trained text generation model\n",
    "generator = pipeline('text-generation', model='gpt-4')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Generate test cases from user stories\n",
    "user_story = \"As a user, I want to be able to reset my password\"\n",
    "test_cases = generator(user_story, max_length=200, num_return_sequences=3)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(test_cases)\n",
    "```\n",

    "### **Automating Test Execution with AI**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once test cases are generated, AI can assist in automating their execution. Integration of AI with testing frameworks like Selenium or Cypress enables dynamic script creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Using AI for Dynamic Test Generation in Selenium:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from selenium import webdriver\n",
    "from transformers import pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "# Setup WebDriver\n",
    "driver = webdriver.Chrome()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Generate automated tests\n",
    "test_case_generator = pipeline('text-generation', model='gpt-4')\n",
    "test_case = test_case_generator(\"Test login functionality\", max_length=100)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Parse generated test case and execute\n",
    "for step in test_case:\n",
    "    # Example steps could be parsed and executed\n",
    "    driver.get(\"https://example.com/login\")\n",
    "    driver.find_element_by_id(\"username\").send_keys(\"user\")\n",

    "### **Bug Detection and Prediction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Using historical defect data, AI models can predict where future bugs may occur in the code, helping testers focus on high-risk areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Steps:**\n",
    "1. Collect historical defect data.\n",
    "2. Train a classification model (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict the likelihood of bugs in certain code paths.\n",
    "3. Integrate this model into your CI/CD pipeline to analyze new code commits.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\n",
    "\n",
    "# Training data (features can include lines of code, complexity, past bug history)\n",
    "X_train = ...\n",
    "y_train = ...\n",
    "\n",
    "# Train model\n",
    "model = RandomForestClassifier()\n",
    "model.fit(X_train, y_train)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Predict likelihood of bugs in new code\n",
    "new_code_features = ...\n",
    "bug_probability = model.predict(new_code_features)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"Predicted Bug Probability: {bug_probability}\")\n",

    "Generative AI can also help produce realistic test data that mimic actual user behavior, or generate edge-case scenarios for robust testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example Using GPT-4 for Test Data Generation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "test_data_generator = pipeline('text-generation', model='gpt-4')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Generate realistic test data for a form\n",
    "prompt = \"Generate test data for a user registration form\"\n",
    "test_data = test_data_generator(prompt, max_length=100)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(test_data)\n",
