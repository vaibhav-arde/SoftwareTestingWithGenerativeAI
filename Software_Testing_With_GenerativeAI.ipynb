    "\n",
    "- **Automate Regression Cases**:  \n",
    "  In your AI prompt, mention that certain critical scenarios (e.g., login, checkout) should be part of the regression test suite, and include instructions for automation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "### **3. Generating Test Requirements Using AI**\n",
    "\n",
    "AI can help outline detailed test requirements by analyzing high-level project descriptions or product requirements. Here's how to ensure optimal results:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Tips for Test Requirements Generation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Translate Functional Requirements**:  \n",
    "  Use AI to break down functional requirements into actionable test cases. For example:\n",
    "  - \"Translate the requirement for user registration into detailed test scenarios.\"\n",
    "  - Example output: \"Test if user can register with a valid email. Validate registration with social accounts. Handle invalid inputs such as empty fields.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Define Acceptance Criteria**:  \n",
    "  AI can help articulate acceptance criteria for each requirement. Prompt with:\n",
    "  - \"What are the acceptance criteria for a successful login functionality?\"\n",
    "  - Example output: \"User can log in with valid credentials. System locks account after 3 failed attempts.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Check Dependencies**:  \n",
    "  Ask AI to generate a list of dependencies between different test cases and features.  \n",
    "  Example: \"Identify dependencies between checkout and payment gateway tests.\"\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### **Tips for Test Case Creation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Break Down User Stories**:  \n",
    "  Input user stories into AI and ask it to generate corresponding test cases.  \n",
    "  Example:  \n",
    "  - **User Story**: \"As a user, I want to browse the product catalog by category.\"\n",
    "  - **AI Output**: \"Test Case: Verify category selection displays relevant products. Check for filters like brand, size, and price.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Functional Scenarios**:  \n",
    "  Ensure the AI covers both positive and negative test cases. For example:\n",
    "  - \"Generate positive and negative test cases for product search functionality.\"\n",
    "  - Example: \"Positive case: Valid product name shows results. Negative case: Invalid keyword returns no results.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Be Specific and Clear**:  \n",
    "  The more detailed your prompt, the better the AI’s output. Include details about technologies (e.g., Selenium, Python), tools, or specific types of tests (e.g., performance, API).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Combine Human Expertise**:  \n",
    "  Use AI suggestions to augment your knowledge, but always validate and customize AI-generated test plans and requirements to meet your project's context.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Generate Variations**:  \n",
    "  If the AI output is too generic or lacks depth, modify the prompt and ask it to regenerate test cases with more context. Example:\n",
    "  - \"Provide detailed UI test scenarios for user registration, including form validation.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Maintain Flexibility**:  \n",
    "  Use AI to generate a foundation, but leave room for flexibility to modify the test plan as the project progresses.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### **Best Practices**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use AI to Identify Test Scenarios**:  \n",
    "  Provide AI with function definitions or class structures, and ask it to generate test scenarios.  \n",
    "  Example:  \n",
    "  - Prompt: \"Generate unit tests for a Python function that calculates user discounts.\"\n",
    "  - AI Output: Tests for valid input, invalid input, boundary conditions, and edge cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mocking External Dependencies**:  \n",
    "  Ensure to mock external API calls, database connections, or other dependencies when generating unit test cases. Prompt AI to include mocking as part of the test structure.  \n",
